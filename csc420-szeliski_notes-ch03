Image Processing

Motivation
To preprocess the image, convert it into some form that allows further analysis.
E.g. of conversion operations:
	- exposure correction
	- colour balancing
	- reduction of img noicse
	- increase sharpnesss
	- straightening img

Overview
	[3.1] Point operators 
		- transformations that manipulate each pixels independently of its neighbour pixels.
	[3.2-3.3] Neighbourhood (area-based) operators 
		- new pixel's value depends on a small neighbourhood of input values.
		[3.4] E.g. fourier transformation
	[3.5] Cascading Operators (e.g. into img pyramids and wavelets)
	[3.6] Global Operators (e.g. geometric transformations) 
	[3.7] Global Optimization 
		- minimization of energy functional/optimal estimation with Bayesian Markov random field models. 

3.1 Point Operators

	Pixel A's old value (input) --> Point Operator --> Pixel A's new value (output)

	Examples of point operators (point processes):
		- brightness and contrast adjustments
		- colour correction

	Overview
		- image compositing and matting
		- histogram equalization
		- tonal values manipulation
